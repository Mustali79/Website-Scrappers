Moby is a new payment app, brought to you by MobileCoin, designed to usher in the next era of commerce. Our team redesigned payments from the ground up to support novel experiences that traditional finance wasn’t built for like: 

Creator economy: Uncut tips and subscriptions directly from a global fanbase
Direct-to-consumer: Instant settlement without intermediaries
Merchants: Avoid swipe fees and chargebacks
Peer-to-Peer: Pay friends away from prying eyes with digital cash
Last mile banking: Close the gap for the unbanked and underbanked

We’re looking for someone to help get Moby into the hands of our first million customers by driving our creator marketing and user-generated content strategy across emerging marketing channels.

You’re a self-starter that can drive your marketing plan from ideation to execution; rapidly iterating as you learn about what works and what doesn’t 
You’re excited to source creators with aligned values that will drive authentic experiences for our customers
You cringe when brands sell to their audiences using business jargon; instead, you focus on captivating, creative, and entertaining storytelling that creates connection
You’re outcomes-driven and aren’t afraid to experiment with new tactics to drive results. You relentlessly pursue growth by creating a hypothesis-driven roadmap to acquire and retain new customers. 
You can create memorable experiences for Moby’s customers through experiential marketing; bridging the digital with IRL events
You’ll continuously test and refine our marketing message matrix across multiple platforms so that we’re delivering the right message to the right audience at the right time
You’ll drive quality growth by creating experiences that turn customers into advocates. We prefer flywheels over funnels so you’ll be responsible for acquiring customers who bring in more customers

Minimum Requirements: 

3-5 years of experience in social media marketing
Self-starter who can hit the ground running and works well with others
Experience in a Gen Z-focused, B2C startup 
Desire to grow into a lead role; eventually building out a world-class Marketing team

>1 year professional coding experience with great references and examples of contributions you made to the team / project
or an Android application in the app store that you can share and talk in detail through the source code

Most importantly, you have a passion for Android development and are excited to work with an experienced team on a brand new, state of the art codebase. Our Android app is a Kotlin Compose Hilt based architecture, with a Kotlin Multi-platform business logic state machine shared between Android, iOS, and javascript clients.

Your Android mentor will be Jay Bobzin, in/jbbobzin/ who has been building Android applications for over 10 years, including being a core maintainer and staff eng for the Uber Rider app. He is excited to train someone to overtake him as the primary Android expert at the company, so that he can dedicate more energy to some particular rough edges when building mobile apps for crypto backends.
