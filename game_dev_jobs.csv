            United Kingdom",United Kingdom, 2023-02-02 ,"ABOUT SPLASH DAMAGEWe believe that games play better with friends. For more than 20 years, we‚Äôve been creating team-based multiplayer experiences that have entertained tens of millions of players all over the world and forged countless new friendships along the way.Our studio culture is rooted in our open, friendly, and collaborative environment. Our games are made by people from all over the world, from our entry-level Fresh Talent hires to industry veterans, and we believe that fostering that diverse culture is the best way to build both our games and our studio. We have won numerous awards, including a ‚ÄòWorld-Class‚Äô accreditation by Best Companies and being named one of the UK‚Äôs 100 Best Large Companies to work for.While our offices are based in Bromley, UK, our people have access to progressive working patterns that give them the flexibility to decide how to do their best work.THE OPPORTUNITYEver wanted to make your own mark on a shooter? Well at Splash Damage, there‚Äôs plenty of opportunity to do just that ‚Äì depending on the size of the team (we make different size projects to suit different people), you‚Äôll manage the design for the whole game, or own one of area of the game completely. Sound interesting? Good - this is a pivotal role at the heart of a dynamic team of talented people who love to get stuff done.THE TEAMAs a Lead Game Designer, you‚Äôll be a terrific mentor to designers and someone the Design Director trusts and looks toward to help to communicate and evangelise the game vision, helping the team express their goals through a fantastic player experience. At Splash Damage, we genuinely believe in teams collaborating, so you can expect to be talking to artists, animators, programmers, writers, and a whole load of other people on the team too. What better way to align teams, than by talking to them?THE DOCSWe often use documents to communicate our intent, keeping them fun, clear, and sometimes illustrated! We also use templates to make everyone lives a bit easier, so you won‚Äôt need to spend days locked in a room writing by candlelight. But in the end, documents are there to get ideas across, so expect to follow up in person to help people grasp ideas and answer questions. After all, it really helps if everyone is bought into the idea and is excited to help realise it in game.THE FUN STUFFYou‚Äôll own whole feature designs of the game, and at times, the whole game itself! Sometimes that will mean pitching an initial idea, getting feedback from feature teams and once design, art and programming have had a chance to kick the tyres, getting a prototype up and running. But at other times, that will mean you‚Äôll be managing, mentoring, and coaching Game Designers on your team, working alongside Production to help them realise their designs in the build.Once in game, the fun really begins ‚Äì you‚Äôll help teams with balancing, think about the metrics you need and let people know about any development restrictions, after all constraints can really help junior members find their feet! When you‚Äôre ready, you‚Äôll lead focus group sessions, gather feedback, and share your findings with the product team ‚Äì together you can figure out whether it‚Äôs what your players really want!COMMUNICATING WELLAt Splash Damage, we believe in communicating well, always remembering who we‚Äôre talking to and how they might perceive what we‚Äôre saying. You‚Äôll have the chance to talk to external partners and feedback on their deliverables and manage relationships, plus chat to the Press, our Fans, and the community, as well as speak in pre-recorded sessions and live events. And don‚Äôt worry, if public speaking isn‚Äôt your thing, there‚Äôs even help with that too. You will regularly present the areas of the game you are responsible for to the studio. Where necessary you will act as the deputy to the Design Director.We believe everyone can be a leader in their field. We‚Äôd like you to become one of them.YOUR EXPERIENCEA love of games ‚Äì you make them, you buy them, you play them & talk about them!A strong grasp of game design, but with an area you really get excited about ‚Äì it could be narrative, game-feel, retention, usability, player motivation or something else.Industry experience in a Lead position on one AAA console or PC title that featured a multiplayer component and worked on it from beginning to end: hopefully a 1st or 3rd person shooter!Capacity to think and communicate in terms of the player experienceHappy working independently and are drawn to solving problemsLeadership experience, including running a multi-person design team and familiarity with managing the performance of designers on your team.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT | UNREAL ENGINE
What We Do
Unreal Engine‚Äôs BD team helps customers across verticals maximize their adoption of Unreal Engine and related products towards a robust and vibrant Metaverse.
What You'll Do
This role will strategically develop business with key Games accounts by maximizing the value of UE for partners on existing projects and driving further adoption of UE (and other Epic tools and services) across those key accounts. The essence of this job is to make UE and partnership with Epic invaluable to the world‚Äôs best game developers and publishers. The BDM will serve as the glue that connects partner needs to UE‚Äôs capabilities and to Epic Games as a whole.¬†
BDMs don‚Äôt provide reactive support and their involvement with key accounts is not transactional. They are engaged in an ongoing manner and proactively work with UE licensees to deeply understand the unique needs of their projects and strategically gain line of sight to future needs/projects (including sister studios within parent organizations). SBDMs materially improve the finished product by marrying their knowledge of customer needs with their insight into features/roadmap of UE (and other Epic tools and services). They assure that partners are maximizing their use of UE, even in ways and on projects they might not have previously considered.
Given that this is a new discipline, the BDM will have to thrive with ambiguity, excel at creating new processes that fit into existing frameworks, and then be able to scale those new processes across a broader set of accounts. Ideally, the BDM will also have the potential to manage a team of BDMs should the need arise to further resource this discipline.
In This Role You Will

Be the voice of Epic with major partners and key accounts
Maximize value of UE to key accounts by marrying partner needs to UE/Epic capabilities
Be the subject matter expert on some of Epic‚Äôs biggest partners: gather critical intelligence and report internally on partner needs, dev cycles, network of sister studios, tech decision process, concerns etc.
Determine relationship plan, drive ongoing efforts to educate, train and keep key accounts up to date with everything UE and Epic as a whole
Drive internal key account review process
Strategically identify and maximize opportunities to drive further adoption of UE within key accounts
Serve as voice of key accounts internally to support, engine team, and UE execs
Serve as key bridge between (i) key accounts and Epic, (ii) BD and Support

What We're Looking For

Prior experience with all categories of game developers; from AAA and AA to Indie and Mobile.
Experience in a sales or business development capacity working with the game developer community in the Americas
Highly motivated, goal oriented, self starter capable of working at a high level in a team or on their own
Management experience within high growth organizations
Strong communication and interpersonal skills to effectively work with a variety of positions and functions within and outside the organization
Intimate knowledge of the games community in the Americas
Strong connections in the games community
Experience negotiating with international organizations
Proficiency in any other languages is a plus
You‚Äôre user-focused, passionate, scrappy, solutions-focused, and innovative. These traits equal success at Epic and influence everything we do.
