Our insight is simple: as these organizations scale and become the new business norm, they need crypto-native solutions to help them with basic financial operations, so they can focus on their business.The current state of financial tooling is appalling. It’s still insanely hard to make crypto transactions, monitor cashflows, or simply swap crypto with USD and EUR. These organizations have no control nor visibility over their crypto finances — they know things will fall apart.So we created Multis. Our mission is to build the financial backbone of web3 organizations and empower them to build a better Web.Today, Multis is an all-in-one crypto management app designed to help web3 organizations feel confident and in control of their crypto finances. We help them automate payments in crypto and USD, monitor cashflows in real time and close their books 5x faster.Want to know more about Multis?Company culture, teams, technical stack, jobs...

The Market Operations team is responsible for overseeing the launch strategy and deployment of Worldcoin in different markets. The Market Operations team also serves as the primary point of contact for local Operators, running Operator recruitment and selection, supporting Operators, and ensuring optimal performance. Overall, the Market Operations team is on the frontlines of Worldcoin’s ambitious mission of global, inclusive, and rapid distribution of the Worldcoin token.
The Market Operations team is broken up into two sub-teams: (1) Expansion Operations team and (2) Growth Operations. Both teams provide input into the growth strategy. Once a new market is selected, the Expansion Operations team focuses on entering that market, from recruiting Operators to running local marketing initiatives. Then the Growth Operations team steps in, focusing on scaling within the new market by generating inbound and outbound initiatives to drive user adoption and improve Orb efficiency.
About the Opportunity:
We are looking for highly motivated individuals to lead Worldcoin’s launch operations in cities around the world.  Within their respective regions and cities, launchers will be responsible for finding and onboarding new Operators – these independent, entrepreneurial individuals who sign up new users – and running creative campaigns to generate awareness about of Worldcoin.
Key Responsibilities:

Launch. Oversee key launch activities for your respective regions and cities, including identifying and onboarding Orb Operators and designing marketing and on-the-ground efforts.
Build. Build teams and cross-functional systems to support launch efforts.
Strategize. Consolidate launch insights to inform Worldcoin’s strategy for future markets.   
Collaborate. Work cross-functionally with the Logistics, Product, and Marketing teams to create and execute highly-localized campaigns. 
Scale. Use data and key learnings to efficiently and effectively scale launch campaigns to hundreds of cities around the World. 

About You:

You have 3+ years of relevant operations experience. You have experience in project management, consulting, or other operations-heavy roles.
You’re scrappy. You enjoy working as part of a fast-moving, dynamic team and are willing to contribute wherever needed to make an impact.
You’re innovative. You love coming up with solutions to unconventional problems and taking action.
You’re an effective communicator. You have strong presentation skills, particularly for in-person meetings with multiple, diverse stakeholders. Superior written communication skills are also a must. 
You’re analytical. You use data to inform your decision making and know what kind of data you need and how to get it.
