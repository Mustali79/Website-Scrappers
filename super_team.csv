Contribute to the estimations, planning and execution of  projects, features, and integrations.

You’re comfortable working a full stack role on the front and backend.
You have either had experience with some of our tech stack or are confident you can cross train and up skill quickly. 
You’ve got a deep understanding of database structures, theories, principles, and best practices.
You have cloud native experience with AWS or similar e.g Google Cloud
Bonus points if you make open-source contributions or have experience in payments or FinTech.

You’ve got a deep understanding of database structures, theories, principles, and best practices.
You have cloud native experience with AWS or similar e.g Google Cloud
Bonus points if you make open-source contributions or have experience in payments or FinTech.

      Remote
    


At Phantom, security is core to the product and the reason why millions of people trust Phantom to securely store their crypto assets. As an Application Security Engineer, you will be responsible for identifying, exploiting and mitigating security vulnerability risks in our software applications, as well as conducting security assessments and investigations. You will work closely with development teams to ensure that security is integrated throughout the software development lifecycle. Join us on our mission to make the digital economy safe and easy to use for everyone.
This role is fully remote; however, we’re only open to candidates based in US and EU time zones.
Responsibilities

Perform regular security assessments and red teaming exercises to simulate real-world attacks.
Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in code, systems and networks through manual testing, automated tools, and threat intelligence.
Keep up to date with the latest offensive security techniques, application security threats, and best practices in the blockchain space, and recommend improvements to security posture
Write detailed reports of your findings and present them to management and technical teams, and help to prevent real-world attacks.
Work with development teams to implement secure coding practices.
Collaborate with teams such as development, operations, and compliance to ensure that security is integrated throughout the organization.
Participate in incident response and incident management activities.

Qualifications

3+ years of experience in offensive security techniques, with a focus on blockchain technology.
Strong understanding of security risks, vulnerabilities and concepts in web and mobile applications.
Proficient in code review for JavaScript & Typescript with a strong understanding of application security threats and offensive security techniques.
Write PoC’s to prove vulnerabilities, review and ensure that patch code meets the standards set by the repository owners and maintainers.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills + verbal and written communication skills.

Why Work with Us
Opportunity
We are a team of experienced builders with a ton of traction in a big and growing market – our users are so passionate they were hacking their way into our private beta. Only months after launching we've acquired millions of users, and are adding hundreds of thousands every week. We are by far the leading wallet on Solana, and plan to expand to other chains soon.
On top of that, there has never been a better time to work in crypto and on wallets in particular.

Wallets play a pivotal role: Wallets are responsible for on-boarding new users into crypto, and can make or break the user experience.
We are moving to a multi-chain world: New blockchains and scaling solutions are coming online and gaining traction, but are lacking decent wallets and bridges.
DeFi & NFTs are exploding : Interest in DeFi and NFTs has exploded, yet they are still an after-thought in existing wallets.

Benefits

Competitive salary and equity.
Comprehensive insurance (medical/dental/vision) — 100% covered.
Stipend for your ideal remote / WFH set-up: laptop, headphones, and any other work gear you may need.
Flexible hours and a long-standing, supportive remote environment.
Monthly co-working space and mobile phone expense.
Unlimited vacation: Take time when you need it (and we really mean it).
401(k) retirement plan (although we are not matching at this time)
Wellness benefit
Daily lunch benefit

The target base salary for this role will range between $150,000 to $250,000 with the addition of equity and benefits. This is determined by a few factors including your skillset, prior relevant experience, quality of interviews and market factors (such as location) at the point in time of offer.

About the Graph
The Graph is the indexing and query layer of web3.  The Graph Network’s self service experience for developers launched in July 2021. Developers build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that applications can query using GraphQL. The Graph supports indexing data from multiple different networks including Ethereum, NEAR, Arbitrium, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, Celo, Fantom, Moonbeam, IPFS, and PoA with more networks coming soon. To date, tens-of-thousands of subgraphs have been deployed on the hosted service, and now subgraphs can be deployed directly on the network. Over 28,000 developers have built subgraphs for applications such as Uniswap, Synthetix, KnownOrigin, Art Blocks, Balancer, Livepeer, DAOstack, Audius, Decentraland, and many others.
If you are a developer building an application or web3 application, you can use subgraphs for indexing and querying data from blockchains. The Graph allows applications to efficiently and performantly present data in a UI and allows other developers to use your subgraph too! You can deploy a subgraph to the network using the newly launched Subgraph Studio or query existing subgraphs that are in the Graph Explorer. The Graph would love to welcome you to be Indexers, Curators and/or Delegators on The Graph’s mainnet. Join The Graph community by introducing yourself in The Graph Discord for technical discussions, join The Graph’s Telegram chat, and follow The Graph on Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, and Medium! The Graph’s developers and members of the community are always eager to chat with you, and The Graph ecosystem has a growing community of developers who support each other.
The Graph Foundation oversees The Graph Network. The Graph Foundation is overseen by the Technical Council. Edge & Node, StreamingFast, Figment, Semiotic  and The Guild are five of the many organizations within The Graph ecosystem.

We rely on our open and inclusive culture to foster speed, innovation and responsibility. Our diverse team is an ongoing inspiration for easy, effective and accessible products.
Join our mission to onboard the world into web3 and empower millions to own, create and share value freely.
The Discipline ❤️Our engineering discipline builds the technology that enables MoonPay to learn quickly and scale easily. We organise in small cross-functional squads of 3-5 engineers and an embedded Product Manager, Product Designer and Product Data Analyst. We currently have 3 squads across Payments / Finance, Compliance / Fraud and Core Product / Growth. Over time these squads will split out and we are also building new squads focusing on new revenue streams and product verticals. We’re pragmatic and believe in having fluid structure, this means people can move between teams or specialise.
Tech Stack 💻 

Typescript as our programming language of choice 
Node.JS for our backend platform
GraphQL & REST for communicating between our frontend and backend
TypeORM, TypeDI, Type-GraphQL and Routing-Controllers for our backend libraries
React with Apollo for building our customer facing products

What you’ll do 👀

Architect and develop new and existing products and features.
Work with Product Managers to come up with the best solutions and implementation plans for new features or changes to existing ones.
Implement UX and UI in our customer facing app and sometimes design it yourself based on our existing design system and components.
Scale our systems to support our ever growing partner and consumer base. 
Contribute to the estimations, planning and execution of  projects, features, and integrations.
Integrate and work closely with external service providers to ensure smooth operation.
Maintain and improve our existing codebase.
Write fully tested, high quality and performant code on both backend and frontend.

As a Senior you will be expected to:

Mentor and coach Engineers.
Champion the writing of high quality code.
Contribute to our overall approach and standards within the Engineering discipline.
Lead squads from an Engineering perspective, partnering closely with Product Managers. 

You should apply if ✅

You have extensive engineering experience at leading startups or fast growing tech companies.
You are confident developing, releasing and maintaining web applications in a fast paced, iterative environment. 
You’re comfortable working a full stack role on the front and backend.
You have either had experience with some of our tech stack or are confident you can cross train and up skill quickly. 
You’ve got a deep understanding of database structures, theories, principles, and best practices.
You have cloud native experience with AWS or similar e.g Google Cloud
Bonus points if you make open-source contributions or have experience in payments or FinTech.

These are ideal but not all required as we know some people (e.g women) are less likely to apply for the role unless they are 100% qualified. We promote a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture at MoonPay.

B - Be Humble
L - Lead with Empathy

QA Engineer

    at Phantom
  
(View all jobs)

      Remote
    


Our crypto wallet is used by millions of people to access apps and financial services built on the Solana blockchain. As a QA engineer, you’ll be supporting some of the best engineers in the industry by creating processes and automating testing while focusing on quality, security, and velocity. Join us on our mission to make the digital economy safe and easy for everyone.
This role is fully remote; however, we’re only open to candidates based in US and EU time zones.
Responsibilities

Work with Engineering to establish and evolve formal QA processes, ensuring that the team uses industry-accepted best practices.
Build a test-driven engineering culture that drives improvements in quality.
Automate user stories from the Product Requirements Doc and develop a way to generate test data.
Partner with Engineering and Infrastructure team to leverage automation to allow better reliability and scalability.
Drive performance testing efforts and capture key metrics that help to scale the platform.
Develop and execute test cases, plans, and procedures for applications on the desktop browser and mobile.
Test both Frontend UI and Back-end services.
Work with engineers and project leads to triage and prioritize issues for resolution.

Qualifications

Good written and verbal communication skills.
5+ years experience in Quality Assurance and/or Software development.
Strong knowledge in continuous testing and experience integrating automation scripts in CI/CD pipeline.
Knowledge of application UI (React/React Native), API (Node JS) automation testing tools, BDD automation tools, and automation technologies.
Knowledge of Scrum/Agile methodologies and QA Automation process in SDLC.
Working knowledge of Test Management tools.
Experience troubleshooting issues and identifying the root cause, and writing easy-to-reproduce tickets in tools like Linear/JIRA.
Ability to provide technical help/guidance to other QA team members.
Test planning, test designing and execution, performance and stress testing, and implementing and maintaining quality test automation.

Why Work with Us
Opportunity
We are a team of experienced builders with a ton of traction in a big and growing market – our users are so passionate they were hacking their way into our private beta. Only months after launching we've acquired millions of users, and are adding hundreds of thousands every week. We are by far the leading wallet on Solana, and plan to expand to other chains soon.
On top of that, there has never been a better time to work in crypto and on wallets in particular.

Wallets play a pivotal role: Wallets are responsible for on-boarding new users into crypto, and can make or break the user experience.
We are moving to a multi-chain world: New blockchains and scaling solutions are coming online and gaining traction, but are lacking decent wallets and bridges.
DeFi & NFTs are exploding : Interest in DeFi and NFTs has exploded, yet they are still an after-thought in existing wallets.

Benefits

Competitive salary and equity.
Comprehensive insurance (medical/dental/vision) — 100% covered.
Stipend for your ideal remote / WFH set-up: laptop, headphones, and any other work gear you may need.
Flexible hours and a long-standing, supportive remote environment.
Monthly co-working space and mobile phone expense.
Unlimited vacation: Take time when you need it (and we really mean it).
401(k) retirement plan (although we are not matching at this time)
Wellness benefit
Daily lunch benefit

The target base salary for this role will range between $150,000 to $200,000 with the addition of equity and benefits. This is determined by a few factors including your skillset, prior relevant experience, quality of interviews and market factors (such as location) at the point in time of offer.

      Barcelona, Spain
    


MoonPay is a global team imagining and building the products and culture of tomorrow.
We’re driven by our deep belief that blockchain technology will become the status quo, so we commit all our talent to creating the best web3 experiences for everyone, everywhere.
We rely on our open and inclusive culture to foster speed, innovation and responsibility. Our diverse team is an ongoing inspiration for easy, effective and accessible products.
Join our mission to onboard the world into web3 and empower millions to own, create and share value freely.
The Discipline ❤️Our engineering discipline builds the technology that enables MoonPay to learn quickly and scale easily. We organise in small cross-functional squads of 3-5 engineers and an embedded Product Manager, Product Designer and Product Data Analyst. We currently have 3 squads across Payments / Finance, Compliance / Fraud and Core Product / Growth. Over time these squads will split out and we are also building new squads focusing on new revenue streams and product verticals. We’re pragmatic and believe in having fluid structure, this means people can move between teams or specialise.
Tech Stack 💻 

Typescript as our programming language of choice 
Node.JS for our backend platform
GraphQL & REST for communicating between our frontend and backend
TypeORM, TypeDI, Type-GraphQL and Routing-Controllers for our backend libraries
React with Apollo for building our customer facing products
Postgres as our core database
AWS 

What you’ll do 👀

Architect and develop new and existing products and features.
Work with Product Managers to come up with the best solutions and implementation plans for new features or changes to existing ones.
Implement UX and UI in our customer facing app and sometimes design it yourself based on our existing design system and components.
Scale our systems to support our ever growing partner and consumer base. 
Contribute to the estimations, planning and execution of  projects, features, and integrations.
Integrate and work closely with external service providers to ensure smooth operation.
Maintain and improve our existing codebase.
Write fully tested, high quality and performant code on both backend and frontend.

As a Senior you will be expected to:

Mentor and coach Engineers.
Champion the writing of high quality code.
Contribute to our overall approach and standards within the Engineering discipline.
Lead squads from an Engineering perspective, partnering closely with Product Managers. 

You should apply if ✅

You have extensive engineering experience at leading startups or fast growing tech companies.
You are confident developing, releasing and maintaining web applications in a fast paced, iterative environment. 
You’re comfortable working a full stack role on the front and backend.
You have either had experience with some of our tech stack or are confident you can cross train and up skill quickly. 
You’ve got a deep understanding of database structures, theories, principles, and best practices.
You have cloud native experience with AWS or similar e.g Google Cloud
Bonus points if you make open-source contributions or have experience in payments or FinTech.

These are ideal but not all required as we know some people (e.g women) are less likely to apply for the role unless they are 100% qualified. We promote a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture at MoonPay.
